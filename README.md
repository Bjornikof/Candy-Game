# Candy-Game
This is a candy game project that I was asked to do during "Data Structures and Algorithms" course.

## Rules
* 1)You can crush candies only within the same stack.
* 2)You can crush same colored or same shaped candies.
* 3)You can only crush 3 candies that are side by side. (e.g. 4 candies won't be crushed even if the conditions of rule 2 are met.)
* 4)You can pop and push one candy at a time. You can push the candy to any other stack.
* 5)You can't pop and push a candy to the same stack. (e.g. Popping from Stack 1 and pushing to Stack 1 won't work.)
* 6)Next candy will always be added to the first stack.
